# AirBnB_clone
## The Console
This project tackles an important portion of the AirBnB program <br>On completion of this portion, the console should:
* put in place a parent class (BaseModel) that takes care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
